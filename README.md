Welcome to the Puzzle Game! 🧩
In this game, your goal is to assemble a puzzle by arranging the pieces to form an image. 
To play, drag the puzzle pieces into their correct positions. You can choose the number of 
pieces you'd like to play with by selecting an option below. Once you've decided, click the 
big button to start the timer. When you finish the puzzle, your score will be displayed on 
the leaderboard! 🏆 The score is calculated based on the time you take and the number of 
puzzle pieces you selected. You can also customize your game by changing the puzzle image. 
At the bottom of the screen, there's a text prompt where you can paste a link to an image. 
Once you've done that, you're all set! Enjoy the challenge and have fun! 🎉
